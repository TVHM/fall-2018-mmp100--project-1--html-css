 <p>Born in O'Fallon Illinois,
   Born William Franklin Beedle, Bill Holden was the son of an entrepreneur and in many
   respects would have rather been known for the legacy of his innovative thinking as an
   entrepreneur than his craft as a great actor in the movies.
   During his time in the film industry, he became a business man and a global philanthropist.
   
   Though determined to do the best at whatever his endeavor,
   Bill Beedle set a standard for integrity,success and hard work.

</p><div>The 1950 classic  Sunset Blvd. starring Bill Holden Gloria Swanson
  was a true and honest story about the popular culture of Hollywood.
  Nearly all the actors in the film portrayed snippets of their authentic life story.
  Swanson having been a washed up film star from the "silent movie era"and Holden
  instead of being a struggling script writer was at the time a struggling actor
  having difficulty  finding good paying and respectful roles that is until he found
  the blockbuster film noir in Sunset Blvd.</div><div><p>
  In 1939 Holden made his movie debut with Golden Boy.  He would eventually star in some of the most popular and critically
  acclaimed films of all time including such blockbusters such as:
  <ul>
  <li>Sunset Boulevard
  <li>The Wild Bunch
  <li>Picnic
  <li>The Towering Inferno
