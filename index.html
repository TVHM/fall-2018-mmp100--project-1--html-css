  <h2> William Holden </h2><div></div>
 <p>Born April 17, 1918, the son of an entrepreneur in O'Fallon Illinois, William Franklin Beedle,Jr., better
   known as William Holden, was in many respects more of a business man and global philanthropist
   than a movie star.  According to friends and others who knew him personally, he would have rather been known for
   a legacy of innovative thinking in medicine or science.  Determined to do the best
   at whatever his endeavor, Bill Beedle set a life time standard for integrity,
   success and hard work.
</p><div><p>In 1939 Holden made his movie debut with Golden Boy.</p>
  <p>In 1950 Holden co starred with Gloria Swanson, Nancy Olsen
  and the TV show <strong>"Dragnet"</strong> famed actor, Jack Webb in the movie <strong> Sunset Blvd </strong>,
  directed by Billy Wilder. The film depicted a true and honest story about popular culture
  and the fictious life of Hollywood.  Nearly all the performers in the film portrayed
  snippets of their real life.  For example, Gloria Swanson, portraying Norma Desmond,
  was actually once a famous film star from the silent
  era.  Having now a washed up career in the film she becomes obsessed by Holden who potrayed
  the struggling script writer Joe Gillis.  Although not quite struggling in real life,
  Holden was at the time having difficulty finding the type of roles he felt
  comfortable potraying. That is until he found "it" in the blockbuster noir film classic.
  Sunset Blvd remains a popular Hollywood movie even to this day.

  William Holden would eventually star in some of the most popular and critically
  acclaimed films of all time, including such blockbusters as:
  <ul>
  <li>Bridge on the River Kwai
  <li>The Wild Bunch
  <li>Picnic
  <li>The Towering Inferno
  <li>Network
  <li>Stalag 17
  </ul></div><div>
<p> Holden was full of courage and curiosity and to this day his life is emulated by many people around the world.
  His life and career reflected an immersive freedom of the spirit. Relentless in defining himself
  not as a part of the status quo but rather as an individual.  His filmography would often intersect
  with that of fiction and reality, portraying the anti-hero in films that revealed true stories of honesty
  and truth through a process of compelling thought and action.  For example, Holden helped bring wildlife conservation
  and awareness to the world. In 1957 he immigrated to Kenya and along with oil businessman Ray Ryan
  and their Swiss partner established the <strong> African Safari Club </strong>.
  Through his efforts and those of many great others, Holden contributed to transforming the African Big Game
  'hunting' culture into an African Big Game culture of "animal conservation".</p>
